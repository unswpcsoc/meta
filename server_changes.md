# PCSoc Discord Changes FAQ

1. Are the server rules staying the same? 
The rules will be unchanged for now, but once Arc publishes a concrete set of rules for Discord servers, they may be changed. We will notify you of this.

2. Can I verify online instead? 
No, verification has to be done in person. We are working on changing this.

3. Do I have to be verified in person even if I know an exec personally? 
Yes, everyone needs to be verified in person. We are working on changing this.

4. Does that mean I have to pay for access now? 
No, we have no membership fee even for non-UNSW members. PCSoc has been and will continue to be Free.

5. I’m a non-UNSW student/UNSW alumni, can I stay in this server?
Yes! [Fill out our form and receive verification in person](https://goo.gl/forms/K46wh2P3RMT5dYUC3)

6. Who has access to our personal information? How do I know it’s safe?
As per the constitution, the exec team has access and will not share these details with anybody other than Arc when required. 

We are currently hosting the information in Google Sheets on our society’s private Google Drive account. The only people who have access are the current Executives and David Sison (founder, alumni, and current contributor to the society). 
We understand this is not a tenable long-term solution; it’s a band-aid solution for the short-term since we were given very little notice to comply. Future countermeasures are being considered, but nothing concrete has been decided.

7. Do we keep our levels and XP? 
Yes!

8. What times will the O-Week stall be open? 
10am-4pm Mon-Thurs, 10am-2pm Fri. 

9. Permission to advertise a new server? 
Denied, sorry!

10. Is it possible that a preverification role can see chat without being able to chat?
We're currently asking Arc about this. We’re also investigating whether unverified members can join a voice chat for events before being verified.

11. What about secondary accounts for purposes such as being a microphone?
Most likely should be fine since it’s your account under your ownership. As long as you’re verified, the mic can be verified too.

12. Why do we have to give our Discord IDs?
We need to keep track of your discord account if you change usernames/discord tags occasionally.

13. Is all this set in stone? Is there no chance there will be changes in the future?
Again, we are in talks with Arc, but we are pushing for changes to these requirements. Stay tuned.

14. Why just your server? There are other Arc Affiliated Discord servers out there too.
We just happened to be the first to make these changes. Other Discords (e.g. AUNSW, LoLSoc, MinecraftSoc, etc.) will be receiving similar treatment in the very near future.
