__**Welcome to the Official UNSW Computer Enthusiasts Society Discord Server!**__  (<https://discord.gg/unswpcsoc>)
Discord is a place to interact with other people through text, voice, and memes.

All channels are read-only until you are verified. Verification requires you to complete this form and talk to an Executive **in-person** to receive the role: <https://goo.gl/forms/K46wh2P3RMT5dYUC3>. 

**On Verification, you agree that you have understood and accepted our rules.** If you have any questions, please private message an Executive.

__**Rules**__
Our rules extend the UNSW student code of conduct (<https://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/studentcodepolicy.pdf>). 

**0. Be considerate**
Keep it clean, civil, and legal.
We do not tolerate disruptive, offensive, or overly negative behaviour.
This includes, but is not limited to: racism, sexism, derogatory slurs, trolling/baiting, spamming, doxxing, harassment, excessive self-deprecation and oversharing etc.
Additionally, we do not tolerate jokes targeting mental health issues (e.g. depression, bipolar, etc.), disabilities (e.g. autism, aspergers, etc.), or behaviours arising from these (e.g. self-harm, suicide, etc.).

**1. No gore, no porn**
No gore or implied death/severe injury.

**2. No unsolicited promotions or advertisements**
You must acquire permission from the mods to promote or advertise external parties without it being immediately relevant to the conversation.

**3. Stay on topic**
Read the channel description at the top to see what goes where. 

__Rules defined in the channel description can override these rules. If you are unsure about any of the rules, private message the mods before posting.__

If a rule is broken, a warning will be issued. Repeat offences will attract moderation (mute, kick, ban). Ban evasion results in an instant ban.
